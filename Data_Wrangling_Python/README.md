# Data Cleaning with Pandas

This project demonstrates how to clean a real-world **customer call list dataset** using pandas. The goal is to make the data usable for analysis by removing noise, fixing formatting issues, and eliminating duplicates or invalid entries.

## Key Steps
- Load Excel data from a local file
- Remove duplicates and irrelevant columns
- Clean string values (names, phone numbers)
- Drop customers flagged as "Do Not Contact"
- Handle missing or malformed data

This was a great exercise in **real-world data wrangling**, where data isn't perfect, and every cleaning step counts.
