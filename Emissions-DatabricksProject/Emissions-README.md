#  Project: United States Emissions Analysis Dashboard in Databricks

##  Overview
Designed and implemented a data analysis and visualization pipeline using **Databricks SQL** to examine greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data across the United States, with a focus on population-adjusted emissions and state-by-state comparison.  
The data, sourced from the **EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)**, reflects environmental trends relevant for:
- Policy-making  
- Sustainability planning  
- Public awareness

##  Project Purpose & Why It Matters
Environmental data is increasingly critical for informing climate action.  
This project aimed to:
- Understand how emissions are distributed geographically  
- Identify high-impact states and counties contributing most to national emissions  
- Normalize emissions by population to spot inefficient areas  
- Support data-driven decisions in climate policy and resource allocation  

> This analysis helps organizations or governments prioritize regions for emissions reduction, funding, or regulation.

## Technical Highlights

### Calculations Performed:
- Emissions per person for fairness across population sizes  
- Total emissions by county and state  
- Top 10 states contributing to national emissions  
- Percentage share of those top 10 states in the national total  

### Databricks Dashboard Visuals:
- US map visual of emissions  
- Pie chart for emission distribution  
- Bar chart of top counties by CO₂e  
- Scatter plot showing relationship between population and per-person emissions

## Key Insights Gained
- The top 10 states account for **over 50%** of total US emissions  
- High population counties tend to have **lower per-capita emissions**, suggesting economies of scale or better infrastructure  
- Texas (TX) and Florida (FL) are among the **top emitters**  
- Some smaller counties showed **very high per-person emissions**, hinting at localized industrial activity or inefficiencies  

---

## Impact
- Delivered **clear, interactive visuals** for stakeholders  
- Highlighted **emission inequalities** between regions  
- Showcased how cloud tools like **Databricks** enable scalable, real-time environmental data analysis
