Project: United States Emissions Analysis Dashboard in Databricks
🔍 Overview:
Designed and implemented a data analysis and visualization pipeline using Databricks SQL to examine greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data across the United States, with a focus on population-adjusted emissions and state-by-state comparison. The data, sourced from the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), reflects environmental trends relevant for policy-making, sustainability planning, and public awareness.

Project Purpose & Why It Matters:
Environmental data is increasingly critical for informing climate action. This project aimed to:
•	Understand how emissions are distributed geographically.
•	Identify high-impact states and counties contributing most to national emissions.
•	Normalize emissions by population to spot inefficient areas.
•	Support data-driven decisions in climate policy and resource allocation.
This type of analysis can help organizations or governments prioritize regions for emissions reduction, funding, or regulatory focus.

Technical Highlights:
•	Used Databricks SQL Editor to write reusable, performant SQL queries.
•	Calculated:
o	Emissions per person for fairness across population sizes.
o	Total emissions by county and state.
o	Top 10 states contributing to national emissions.
o	Percentage share of those top 10 states in the national total.
•	Built a Databricks Dashboard with:
o	US map visual of emissions.
o	Pie chart for emission distribution.
o	Bar chart of top counties by CO₂e.
o	Scatter plot to explore relationship between population and per-person emissions.

Key Insights Gained:
•	The top 10 states account for over 50% of total US emissions.
•	High population counties tend to have lower per-capita emissions, suggesting economies of scale or better infrastructure.
•	Texas (TX) and Florida (FL) are among the top emitters, both in total and in contribution percentage.
•	Several counties with relatively small populations showed high per-person emissions, which could indicate localized industrial activity or lower energy efficiency.

Impact:
•	Provided clear, interactive visuals for stakeholders to interpret complex data.
•	Highlighted emission inequalities between regions, supporting more targeted sustainability strategies.
•	Demonstrated how modern cloud analytics platforms (Databricks) can support scalable, real-time environmental data exploration.
