# Movie Correlation Analysis with Python

This project explores the relationships between a movieâ€™s **budget**, **gross earnings**, and other features to identify which factors are most correlated with financial success.

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies) and includes metadata for over 3,800 movies such as budget, revenue, cast, director, genre, and more.
