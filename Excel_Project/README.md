## 🔍 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
Before conducting **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, the dataset was cleaned and prepared for accurate insights:  
✅ **Removed duplicate records** (26 duplicates removed, 1000 unique records remain).  
✅ **Standardized categorical data** (completed missing text for Marital Status & Gender).  
✅ **Converted numerical data** (adjusted Income values for consistency).  
✅ **Created a new column** (`Age Group`) using **Nested IF functions** (categories: Young, Middle Age, Old).

## 📊 Excel Techniques Used  
- **Pivot Tables** – Summarized sales data by **gender, age, income, and commute distance**.  
- **Charts & Graphs** – Visualized sales trends, peak buying seasons, and customer preferences.  
- **Slicers & Filters** – Created an interactive dashboard for deeper analysis.  
- **Conditional Formatting** – Highlighted key trends in sales patterns.
